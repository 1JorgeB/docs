# Style guide

Unraid OS is as much driven by the team at LimeTech, as it is by the Unraid Community. Our collection of documents tries its best to be comprehensive, accurate, and up-to-date, but given our users come from all walks of life, all around the world, it is good to set the stage for any written contributions to the Unraid Docs.

We have written a simple style guide for Unraid Docs and would appreciate it if you took a few minutes to read through it, so you can understand how we write.
