# How to contribute

Once you've read through our style guide and have a basic understanding of Markdown, you are ready to start editing existing pages or creating your own original ones.

## Contribute to a page that already exists

If you want to contribute to an Unraid Docs page that already exists:

1. Select the **Edit this page** button at the bottom of every page. This will take you to our Github repository.
2. Select the edit pencil in the top-right to fork the repository.
3. Make edits to the document on your own branch.
4. Commit pull requests to **Main**.

These edits are then reviewed by Lime Technology staff, edits are made, or suggested, and once complete they can be merged with **Main**.

## Create a new page

To create a new Docs page, for example an Unraid Guide:

1. In Github, go to `docs/unraid-os/guides` and select **Add file** on the right, to add a new guide page.
2. Name your file/guide and give it an `.md` extension. Ensure filenames are lower case and have dashes separating any words. For example `wake-on-lan.md`.
3. Write the guide content.
4. Commit your changes. At this point, a LimeTech employee will review and merge if everything looks good.

Thank you in advance for any and all submissions and edits. Making living technical documentation would be impossible without community involvement!
