# Contributing to Unraid Documentation

Unraid Docs are build using Docusaurus, see the subfolders in this section to learn more about how it works.

Use the connect/ folder inside of docs/connect to learn more about proper usage of this wiki.

The legacy wiki entries are converted from MediaWiki and should not be relied on for documentation or reference on proper wiki formatting.
