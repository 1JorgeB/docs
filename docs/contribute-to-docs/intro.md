# Getting started

## Contribute to Unraid documentation

Unraid OS is versatile, easy to use, and offers a wide range of features for storage, virtualization, and application hosting. It is continuously evolving and being updated by LimeTech staff and other contributors.

### The Unraid Docs style guide

The Unraid documentation style guide provides references and guidelines that help you write documentation that is simple, straightforward, and clear. It answers the key questions about writing choices and ensures that all documentation is consistent in its form and function. The documentation should be a resource that Unraid OS users can trust completely.

### Docusaurus

Our documentation is built on Docusaurus. This is an open-source tool for building documentation sites, developed by Meta. The idea behind Docusaurus is to allow you to write documentation using Markdown and React-based MDX.

For the most part, Docusaurus is based on Markdown, with the ability to use React code, if required. Docusaurus also has some unique structuring elements and formatting syntax that enhance the reading experience.

Our section on Docusaurus includes two tutorials, that teach you to use the majority of its features.
