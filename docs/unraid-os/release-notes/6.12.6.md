# Version 6.12.6 2023-12-01

## Upgrade notes

This release includes bug fixes and an important patch release of OpenZFS. All users are encouraged to upgrade.

### Known issues

If you are using a Realtek 8125 2.5GbE NIC there is an issue with the 'stock' r8169 Linux driver that causes system hang
if you enable jumbo frames. Either do not use jumbo frames or consider installing the Realtek vendor-supplied r8125
driver plugin. (FYI: the stock 'r8169' driver also handles the Realtek 8125 chip sets - there is no separate 'stock' r8125
driver, yes this is confusing).

Please see the [6.12.0 release notes](6.12.0.md#known-issues) for general known issues.

### Rolling back

If rolling back earlier than 6.12.4, also see the [6.12.4 release notes](6.12.4.md#rolling-back).
