# Version 6.12.14 2024-11-26

## Changes vs. [6.12.13](https://docs.unraid.net/unraid-os/release-notes/6.12.13/)

This release includes important bug fixes and security updates.

***ALL USERS ARE STRONGLY ENCOURAGED TO UPGRADE***

### Update Notes

#### New Windows changes may result in loss of access to Public shares

Due to recent security changes in Windows, "guest" access of Unraid Public shares may not work. The easiest
way around this is to create a user in Unraid with the same name as the Windows account you are using to connect.  If the Unraid
user password is not the same as the Windows account password, Windows will prompt for credentials.

If you are using a Microsoft account, it may be better to create a user in Unraid with a simple username, set a password,
then in Windows go to Control Panel -> Credential Manager -> Windows credentials -> Add a Windows Credential and add the
correct Unraid server name and credentials.

Alternately you can [re-enable Windows guest fallback](https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/blog/filecab/accessing-a-third-party-nas-with-smb-in-windows-11-24h2-may-fail/4154300)
(not recommended).
