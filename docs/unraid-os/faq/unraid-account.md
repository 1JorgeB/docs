# Unraid Account

## What is an Unraid.net Account?

An [Unraid.net account](https://account.unraid.net/) is the
account you create to use the [Unraid
forums](https://forums.unraid.net/) and the account used to sign in to
[Unraid Connect](/connect/about.md). This account is _not
the same_ as your server's root password that you use to login to the
Unraid webgui.
## Unraid.net Account Sign In / Ups
The unraid.net account is a single-sign-on (SSO) system that is used for authenticating users to Unraidâ€™s online systems with a single account. This system is accessed through the website located at account.unraid.net.
The unraid.net account allows users to manage their Unraid keys, post on the Unraid forums, and use Unraid Connect. Users do not need to sign into this account to use Unraid.

This SSO service is implemented on top of an AWS Cognito OAuth server, which is a private user database. User privacy is a top priority for us, and all data is stored securely and encrypted. User data is only accessible by Unraid employees.

The account.unraid.net database stores the following data about registered users:
User ID, Username, Email address, Unraid Forum ID, User authorized to download Unraid prereleases
This database also stores attributes used for login, such as Password hash, MFA details, and Google/Apple SSO information.
